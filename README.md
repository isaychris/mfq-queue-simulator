# mfq-queue-simulator

A Multi-feedback queuing system simulator with 4 levels of queue, bundled in a nice GUI. 
* The program loads 16 jobs from mfq.txt and goes through the cpu. If the job does not finish or new job is arrivals into the system while cpu is busy, the job is place into a lower queue.   

* The program will print out to the console when it arrives in the system and when it departs out of the cpu. 

* Lastly, statistics from the simulation is calculated.  

This program was completed as extra credit for my data structures & algorithms course I took over at Palomar College.
