# mfq-queue-simulator

This program simulates a Multi-feedback queuing system with 4 levels of queue while showcasing a nice GUI. The program loads 16 jobs from mfq.txt and goes through the cpu. If the job does not finish or new job is arrivals into the system while cpu is busy, the job is place into a lower queue. The program will print out to the console when it arrives in the system and when it departs out of the cpu. Lastly, statistics from the simulation is calculated.
